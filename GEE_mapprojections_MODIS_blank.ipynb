    "Google Earth Engine is an extremely powerful tool for visualizing environmental data, making it an extremely popular choice in many contexts. However, the combination of Google Earth Engine with Cartopy is even more powerful, combining the on-the-fly ability of GEE to access and analyze data with Cartopy's strengths in map reprojection and generation of production-quality graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the use of Cartopy, we'll use the `cartoee` package. Cartoee functions as a 'go-between' for Earth Engine and Cartopy, by requesting images from Earth Engine and passing them through to Cartopy. In that way, the data can be reprojected as desired using Cartopy without the user having to download all the data from Earth Engine. Because of the utility of this approach, cartoee has been incorporated into `geemap` and can be called from that package such that it can be referred to on its own.\n",
